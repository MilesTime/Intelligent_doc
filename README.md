# Intelligent Document Processing System
Background:
In the context of the increasing demand for digitizing government policies and legal documents, traditional document review processes are inefficient, time-consuming, and error-prone. Manual processing often fails to meet the accuracy and scalability required for handling large volumes of unstructured documents in sectors like finance, compliance, and government.

Description:
Designed and deployed an intelligent document processing system leveraging OCR and Transformer-based large models to address these challenges. The system integrates multimodal Transformer architectures to efficiently recognize content from scanned documents, accurately extracting key information such as the main themes and critical clauses. This approach boosted recognition accuracy to over 90%, representing a 35% improvement compared to conventional OCR methods. By automating the extraction and analysis process, the project significantly reduced manual review efforts, cutting client operational costs by 50% and accelerating document turnaround time.
